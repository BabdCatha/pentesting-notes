ARP Poisoning is a technique that allows us to perform Man In The Middle attacks. Basically, we send malicious [[ARP]] packets to computers on the network, identifying us as another machine. When a machine receives our malicious packet, it stores the corresponding IP/MAC association in its cache, and will now send packets to us when trying to contact a spoofed machine.

We can later send back the packets to the intended target, giving us an opportunity to spy on the traffic.

## Exploiting
+ `arpspoof -i INTERFACE -t TARGET_IP -r GATEWAY_IP`
	+ Packet forwarding needs to be enabled
	+ `sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`
