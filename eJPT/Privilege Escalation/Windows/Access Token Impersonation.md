Access Tokens are an element of the authentication process on Windows. They are managed by the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service ([[LSASS]])

An Access Token is created by winlogon each time a user authenticates. This token will be passed to all processes and threads created by this user, and will run under the privileges allowed by the access token.

There are several levels of security :
+ Impersonation tokens are created as a result of non-interactive login
+ Delegation token are created as a result on an interactive login

The following privileges are required for a successful impersonation attack :
+ SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege : Allows to impersonate tokens
+ SeImpersonatePrivilege : Allows a user to create a process under the security context of another user

And, if using the Potato Attack :
+ SeCreateTokenPrivilege : Allows to create an arbitrary token with administratives privileges

+ `list_tokens -u`
	+ Lists available tokens
+ `impersonate_token "DOMAIN\Account"`
