Alternate Data Streams (ADS) is an [[NTFS]] file attribute.

A basic file on an NTFS partition has two streams :
+ The Data Stream - contains the file data
+ The Resource Stream - contains metadata

We use ADS to hide files from basic static scanning and signature based detection. It is useful to hide something from a user, but not from security software.

We can provide the stream using the `:` symbol
+ `notepad foo.txt:bar` will write data in the bar stream of the foo.txt file
+ `type payload.exe > test.txt:payload` can hide the payload executable
	+ `mklink update.exe test.txt:payload` can be used to access the hidden file via a symbolic link
