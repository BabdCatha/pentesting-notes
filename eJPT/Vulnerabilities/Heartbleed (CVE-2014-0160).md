Targets OpenSSL before version 1.0.1g, allows remote attackers to craft a malicious packet, triggering a buffer over-read, potentially leaking sensitive information such as cryptographic keys.

OpenSSL is normally used to encrypt TLS connections. Leaking the private keys used can lead to decryption of the network traffic.

The Heartbeat Extension (RFC 6520) is an extension of the TLS protocol to check if a peer is still alive, without having to renegotiate the connection.

When sending a Heartbeat request (message type **0x01**), the next two bytes indicate the length of the message, and is given by the user. When the server replies, it needs to send back the initial message. In faulty implementations, if the length that was sent is greater than the actual length of the received message, the server will over-read and send portions of memory that should not have been sent. This memory could include sensitive informations such as passwords from other sessions or cryptographic keys.
