Contrary to [[Passive information gathering]] techniques, active information gathering techniques require direct interaction with the target. This means a higher chance of getting noticed/having an impact on the target.

## DNS Zone Transfers
+ [[DNS Recon#Active methods|DNS Zone Transfers]] can be used to get more info about the target network layout

## Host discovery
+ Process to discover devices on a network
+ We can use [[Nmap]] for this
	+ -sn to not try a port scan after a device is detected
	+ `nmap -sn IP/mask`
+ We can also use [netdiscover](https://www.kali.org/tools/netdiscover/) for this
+ Physical access can be used to map a network, when applicable
+ We can use [[arp-scan]] to try to discover devices when we are on the network
+ Devices that show up with Ping scan may not show up on ARP scan, and vice-versa

## Port scanning
+ Process to discover open ports and services running on a host
+ Also useful to discover what OS is running
+ We can use [[Nmap#Port scan|Nmap]] for this
