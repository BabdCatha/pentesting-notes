A set of techniques to obtain information about a target without directly interacting with it.

Info to get :
[[#IP addresses]]
[[#Hidden directories]]
[[#Whois Enumeration|Names]]
[[#Email addresses]]
[[#Phone numbers]]
[[#Whois Enumeration|Physical address]]
[[#Web technologies]]
[[#Password leaks]]

How to get them :
[[DNS Recon]]
[[Google Dorks]]

## IP addresses
+ `host domain.tld`

## Hidden directories
+ robots.txt
+ sitemap.xml
+ `whatweb domain.tld`
+ [HTTrack](https://www.httrack.com/page/2/fr/index.html) to copy a website and look at its code

## Whois Enumeration
* `whois domain.tld`
Gives info such as :
* Name servers
* Registrar
* Registrant (Names, location, E-mails...)

## Email addresses
+ WHOIS databases
+ [[TheHarvester]]
+ [[Google Dorks]] and the wayback machine to look at older versions of the site, potentially revealing emails that have been hidden since

## Subdomain enumeration
+ Passive, so no bruteforcing here
+ [[Sublist3r]] is a great tool for this
+ [[Google Dorks]] can be useful

## Web Technologies
+ Web Application Firewall : [[Wafw00f]]
+ Builtwith/Wappalyzer plugin for Firefox
+ [[Netcraft]] for a concentration of these informations

## Password leaks
+ Especially useful when emails have been obtained
+ [HaveIBeenPwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)

## Network Mapping
+ Watch the network traffic, with [[Wireshark]] for example
	+ Look at ARP/ICMP messages
