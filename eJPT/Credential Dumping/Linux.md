Not much can be done with Linux password hashes except cracking them.

The information for user accounts is stored in `/etc/passwd`
The passwords are stored in `/etc/shadow`, which is only readable by root

Each line of the file contains nine fields that are separated by colons:

1. **Username.** User account and login name that exist in the system.
2. **Encrypted password.** Password using the format `$type$salt$hashed`
3. **Last password change.** 
4. **Minimum password age.** The minimum number of days that must elapse before the password can be changed by the user.
5. **Maximum password age.** 
6. **Warning period.** The number of days before the password expires, during which time the user gets a warning to change their password
7. **Inactivity period.** The number of days post-expiration (since 01/01/1970) before the user's account is disabled.
8. **Expiration date.** The date on which the account was disabled.
9. **Unused.** This field is left empty and reserved for future use.

	+ Used to dump the hashes of the victim to the local machine, it will also unshadow them, making them ready to be cracked. Also stores them in the database.
+ `auxiliary/analyze/crack_linux`
	+ Used to crack hashes stored in the database using [[john]] or [[hashcat]]
